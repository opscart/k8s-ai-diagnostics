## Definitions

### Agent AI

An **Agent AI** is a reactive system that performs specific tasks when explicitly invoked. It provides recommendations or executes actions based on current state, but does not maintain memory or autonomy between invocations.

**Characteristics:**
- Reactive (responds to explicit requests)
- Stateless (no memory between runs)
- Single-purpose (focused on specific task)
- Human-supervised (requires approval for actions)
- Deterministic (same input produces same output)

**Examples:**
- ChatGPT responding to queries
- Code completion assistants
- Diagnostic tools that analyze on-demand

### Agentic AI

An **Agentic AI** is an autonomous system that continuously monitors its environment, makes decisions, takes actions, and learns from outcomes without human intervention.

**Characteristics:**
- Proactive (initiates actions based on observations)
